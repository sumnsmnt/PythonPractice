# Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.

a = int(input("Enter the number: "))

# both a*2 and a**2 will work fine
print("The square of the number is: ", a**2)
print("The square of the number is: ", a*a) 
# print("The square of the number is: ", a^a) # this will not work
